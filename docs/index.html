      <h3>Artificial Intelligence Markup Language</h3>
      <p>
      AIML is an XML language for specifying the contents of a chat robot character.
      An AIML Interpreter is a program capable of loading and running the bot, and providing the bot’s responses in a
      chat session with a human user, called the client.
      </p>

      <h3>Background and History</h3>
      <p>
        In a previous life I help build a chat bot for an energy company to help answer basic customer questions and a limited number of interactions
        I was hugely proud of the work myself and the team did, the bot was hugely successfuly, saving the company £1000's in customer support costs
        and was also nominated for a number of awards, once only being beaten by the Intel Team who created Stephen Hawkings voice system at
        the <a href="http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/feature/2425076/v3-reveals-shortlist-for-its-technology-awards-2015">2015 V3 Awards</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        That bot was based on a Python 2.x version of an AIML 1.0 interpreter that I converted to Python 3 and then heavily modified to support a wide
        range of additional featurea and capabillities. Most of which have now been added to AIML 2.0 spec. However no one has yet built a fully functional
        Python 3.x interpreter, hence this project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now it implements about 100% of the AIML spec. This version also supports one additional grammar &lt extension &gt, which allows you to call native Python classes,
        similar in a way that the sraix tag works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overtime I intend to write a full AIML 2.0 tutorial as well as comprehensive documentation for using this version of program-y
      </p>
      <p>
        Enjoy and please leave any feedback for me and I'll get back to you. Keiff
