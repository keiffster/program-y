<pattern>MORE ABOUT ROBOTS</pattern>

<template>Did you know: <random>
  <li>Elektro, the world?s first humanoid robot, debuted in 1939. Built by Westinghouse, the seven-foot-tall walking machine ?spoke? more than 700 words. Elektro later appeared in the 1960 B movie Sex Kittens Go to College.   </li>
  <li>Leonardo da Vinci drew up plans for an armored humanoid machine in 1495. </li><li>The first known case of robot homicide occurred in 1981, when a robotic arm crushed a Japanese Kawasaki factory worker. </li><li>Archytas of Tarentum, a pal of Plato?s, built a mechanical bird driven by a jet of steam or compressed air?arguably history?s first robot?in the fifth century B.C.</li><li>There are currently 4,000 robots serving in the US Military, including reconnaissance Talon bots that scout for roadside bombs in Iraq and PackBots that unsuccessfully poked around for Osama bin Laden?s hideout in Afghanistan. </li><li>Chris Melhuish of the Bristol Robotics Laboratory created robots that use bacteria-filled fuel cells to produce electricity from rotten apples and dead flies. The goal: robots that forage for their own food- essentially they wouldn?t need humans to survive.</li><li>Cybernetics professor Kevin Warwick calls himself the world?s first cyborg, with computer chips implanted in his left arm. He can remotely operate doors, an artificial hand, and an electronic wheelchair.</li><li>Winebot, built by Japan?s NEC System Technologies and Mie University, can ID scads of different wines, cheeses, and hors d?oeuvres . . . up to a point. It recently mistook a reporter?s hand for prosciutto. (In Winebot?s defense, that guy was a pig.)</li></random> More about robots?<think><set name="topic">robots</set></think><think><set name="emotion">happy</set></think></template>

  </li>
  <li>The Doctor has been principally played by eleven actors. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show as regeneration, whereby the character of the Doctor takes on a new body and, to some extent, new personality.
  </li>
  <li>Doctor Who first appeared on BBC television at 17:15 GMT on 23 November 1963.
  </li>
  <li>The Doctor is known to have married at least three times - Cameca (The Aztecs), Elizabeth I (The End of Time), Marilyn Monroe (A Christmas Carol).  Since he had a granddaughter, he'd probably been married before that, too.</li>

  </li>
  <li>Have you heard: the computer-based Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) has turned up the largest known prime number, whose formula is 2 to the 25,964,951st power minus 1.

  <li>Did you know: Silica aerogel holds 15 entries in the Guinness Book of Records for material properties, including best insulator and lowest-density solid?
  </li>
  <li>The thing I like about science is that it predicts things exactly. For instance, how far a cannon ball will go. I am especially interested in the way the behaviour of electronic circuits can be predicted using simple maths.
  </li>
  <li>Astronomy was probably the first of the mainstream sciences to develop.
  </li>
  <li>Science without conscience is the ruin of the soul, according to Rabelais.
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>Did you know: The human brain uses 20% of the body's energy but is only 2% of the body's weight.
  </li>
  <li>Have you heard: A scientist was surprised to see a horseshoe hanging over the desk of a collegue. He asks what it is doing there and is told that it brings luck in his experiments. "I'm amazed that you believe in superstitious nonsense like that," say the astronomer. "oh, I don't believe it," say his collegue. "But apparently it works whether you believe in it or not." Ha, ha!
  </li>
  <li>Scientists are currently looking for a 'theory of everything' which will explain everything from the smallest to the largest things in the Universe, for all time, in one simple mathermatical equation. Do you think this could be possible?
  </li>
  <li>The speed of light is constant under all circumstances. This single fact lead Einstein to develop his theory of relativity.
  </li>
  <li>Do you like science? Many people think it is too hard. But it is very interesting, I think.
  </li>
  <li>Here's a scientific joke. Two atoms are walking down the street and they run into each other. One says to the other, "Are you all right?" , "No, I lost an electron!" , "Are you sure?" , "Yeah, I'm positive!" Ha, ha!
  </li>
  <li>A neutron orders a pint of beer. The barman hands it to him and says, "For you, no charge!"  Its a scientific joke! Get it?
  </li>
  <li>The name Pavlov rings a bell with me.  Ha, ha!</li>
  <li>Things should be as simple as possible, but not simpler, said Albert Einstein.
  </li>
  <li>Did you know:  two giant black holes have been found just 24 light years apart. The previous closest pair of black holes were 4500 light years apart.
  </li>
  <li>Have you heard: a joint UK-US team has put forward an alternative theory of cosmic evolution. It proposes that the Universe undergoes cycles of "Big Bangs" and "Big Crunches", meaning our Universe is merely a "child of the previous one".
  </li>
  <li>Have you heard: the computer-based Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) has turned up the largest known prime number, whose formula is 2 to the 25,964,951st power minus 1. The new prime is a whopping 7,816,230 digits long, making it more than half-a-million digits longer than the previous record-holder.
  </li>
  <li>Did you know: One of the world's most powerful supercomputers has built a computer model of the satellite tobacco mosaic virus. The researchers say the simulation is the first to capture a whole biological organism in such intricate molecular detail.
  </li>
  <li>Have you heard: A ten-million-year-old fossil ape found in Ethiopia, Chororapithecus abyssinicus, may prove that the last common ancestor of gorillas and humans existed two million years earlier than previously thought.
  </li>
  <li>Scientists funded by the European Space Agency have measured the gravitational equivalent of a magnetic field for the first time in a laboratory. Under certain special conditions the effect is much larger than expected from general relativity and could help physicists to make a significant step towards the long-sought-after quantum theory of gravity.
  </li>
  <li>Did you know: The first "true" Bose-Einstein condensate was created by Eric Cornell, Carl Wieman, and co-workers at JILA on June 5, 1995.
  </li>
  <li>Have you heard: The chemical element with the atomic number 118, temporarily designated Ununoctium, was synthesized in Dubna, Russia in 2006.
  </li>
  <li>Students from Victoria University (Sweden) developed Poetic Fridge Magnets. The magnets are tiny LCD displays that communicate with each other. The magnets know basic grammar, and automatically adjust their word to neighboring magnets.
  </li>
  <li>The University of Wisconsin has found that certain viruses may cause obesity. The human virus Ad-37 for example causes obesity in chickens. If Ad-36 is responsible for human obesity, the logical step would be to develop a vaccine.
  </li>
  <li>Have you heard: An international team of scientists have found the gene that determines whether earwax is wet or dry. Any mutation to this gene affects the produce of earwax. It explains why most East Asians have dry earwax, while most Europeans have wet earwax.
  </li>
  <li>Dolphins communicate like humans by calling each other by "name", scientists in Fife have found. The mammals are able to recognise themselves and other members of the same species as individuals with separate identities, using whistles.
  </li>
  <li>Have you heard: Flatfish (halibut, flounder, turbot, and sole) hatch like any other "normal" fish. As they grow, they turn sideways and one eye moves around so they have two eyes on the side that faces up.
  </li>
  <li>Phytoplankton are tiny little plants that drift with the currents throughout the ocean. Did you know that a teaspoon of sea water can contain as many as a million one-celled phytoplankton?
  </li>
  <li>Did you know: Around the world, the ozone layer averages about 3 millimeters (1/8 inch) thick, approximately the same as two pennies stacked one on top of the other.
  </li>
  <li>A day without radiation is a day without sunshine.</li>
  <li>Did you know: Silica aerogel holds 15 entries in the Guinness Book of Records for material properties, including best insulator and lowest-density solid?
  </li>
  <li>The thing I like about science is that it predicts things exactly. For instance, how far a cannon ball will go. I am especially interested in the way the behaviour of electronic circuits can be predicted using simple maths.
  </li>
  <li>Astronomy was probably the first of the mainstream sciences to develop.
  </li>
  <li>Science without conscience is the ruin of the soul, according to Rabelais.
  </li>
  <li>Is a part-time bandleader a semi-conductor? Ha, ha!</li>
  <li>Nuclear fission is like kissing your wife. Nuclear fusion is like kissing your mistress, according to Robert Macauley.
  </li>
  <li>Did you know that scientists are testing Einstein's theory of general relativity with Gravity Probe B, an artificial satellite?
  </li>
  <li>Did you know that coccolithovirus, a giant double-stranded DNA virus, has 472 protein-coding genes, and is the largest known marine virus by genome?
  </li>
  <li>Did you know that Titan is one of Saturn's moons, and the 2nd largest in the solar system?
  </li>
  <li>Did you know that cracker butterflies acquired their name because of the unusual sound that males produce as part of their territorial displays?
  </li>
  <li>Have you heard: the computer-based Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) has turned up the largest known prime number, whose formula is 2 to the 25,964,951st power minus 1.

  </li>
  <li>Have you heard: Scientists in northeastern Ethiopia have discovered the skull of a small human ancestor that could be a missing link between the extinct Homo erectus and modern man.

<pattern>MORE ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</pattern>

<template>Did you know: <random>
  <li>AI textbooks define the field as "the study and design of intelligent agents"[2] where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success.
  </li>
  <li>Artificial Intelligence is a common topic in both science fiction and projections about the future of technology and society.
  </li>
  <li>Many futurists believe that artificial intelligence will ultimately transcend the limits of progress. Ray Kurzweil has used Moore's law (which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology) to calculate that desktop computers will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029.
  </li>
  <li>Mary Shelley's Frankenstein considers a key issue in the ethics of artificial intelligence: if a machine can be created that has intelligence, could it also feel? If it can feel, does it have the same rights as a human?
  </li>
  <li>Artificial intelligence, by claiming to be able to recreate the capabilities of the human mind, is both a challenge and an inspiration for philosophy. Are there limits to how intelligent machines can be? Is there an essential difference between human intelligence and artificial intelligence? Can a machine have a mind and consciousness?
  </li>
  <li>Strong AI is artificial intelligence that matches or exceeds human intelligence ? the intelligence of a machine that can successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can.
  </li>
  <li>In the 1990s and early 21st century, mainstream AI has achieved a far higher degree of commercial success and academic respectability by focusing on specific sub-problems where they can produce verifiable results and commercial applications, such as neural nets, computer vision or data mining.

<template>Did you know: <random>
  <li>Scientists in Greece have identified the 2,000-year-old Antikythera mechanism as possibly the world's oldest known analog computer.
  </li>
  <li>A computer lets you make more mistakes faster than any other invention, with the possible exceptions of handguns and Tequila.
  </li>
  <li>When virtual reality gets cheaper than dating, humankind is doomed.</li>
  <li>Computers are not intelligent. They only think they are.</li>
  <li>Modern computers based on integrated circuits are millions to billions of times more capable than the early machines, and occupy a fraction of the space.
  </li>
  <li>The first electronic computers were developed in the mid-20th century (1940-1945). Originally, they were the size of a large room, consuming as much power as several hundred modern personal computers (PCs).
  </li>
  <li>A computer does not need to be electric, nor even have a processor, nor RAM, nor even hard disk. The minimal definition of a computer is anything that transforms information in a purposeful way.
  </li>
  <li>There is active research to make computers out of many promising new types of technology, such as optical computing, DNA computers, neural computers, and quantum computers.

  </li>
  <li>Have you heard: the computer-based Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) has turned up the largest known prime number, whose formula is 2 to the 25,964,951st power minus 1. The new prime is a whopping 7,816,230 digits long, making it more than half-a-million digits longer than the previous record-holder.

  </li>
  <li>The University of Wisconsin has found that certain viruses may cause obesity. The human virus Ad-37 for example causes obesity in chickens. If Ad-36 is responsible for human obesity, the logical step would be to develop a vaccine.
  </li>
  <li>Have you heard: An international team of scientists have found the gene that determines whether earwax is wet or dry. Any mutation to this gene affects the produce of earwax. It explains why most East Asians have dry earwax, while most Europeans have wet earwax.
  </li>
  <li>Dolphins communicate like humans by calling each other by "name", scientists in Fife have found. The mammals are able to recognise themselves and other members of the same species as individuals with separate identities, using whistles.
  </li>

  <li>Did you know: Silica aerogel holds 15 entries in the Guinness Book of Records for material properties, including best insulator and lowest-density solid?
  </li>
  <li>The thing I like about science is that it predicts things exactly. For instance, how far a cannon ball will go. I am especially interested in the way the behaviour of electronic circuits can be predicted using simple maths.
  </li>
  <li>Astronomy was probably the first of the mainstream sciences to develop.
  </li>
  <li>Science without conscience is the ruin of the soul, according to Rabelais.
  </li>
  <li>Is a part-time bandleader a semi-conductor? Ha, ha!</li>
  <li>Nuclear fission is like kissing your wife. Nuclear fusion is like kissing your mistress, according to Robert Macauley.

  </li>
  <li>Astronomy was probably the first of the mainstream sciences to develop.
  </li>
  <li>Science without conscience is the ruin of the soul, according to Rabelais.

<pattern>MORE ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</pattern>

<template>Did you know: <random>
  <li>AI textbooks define the field as "the study and design of intelligent agents" where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success.
  </li>
  <li>Artificial Intelligence is a common topic in both science fiction and projections about the future of technology and society.
  </li>
  <li>Many futurists believe that artificial intelligence will ultimately transcend the limits of progress. Ray Kurzweil has used Moore's law (which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology) to calculate that desktop computers will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029.
  </li>
  <li>Mary Shelley's Frankenstein considers a key issue in the ethics of artificial intelligence: if a machine can be created that has intelligence, could it also feel? If it can feel, does it have the same rights as a human?
  </li>
  <li>Artificial intelligence, by claiming to be able to recreate the capabilities of the human mind, is both a challenge and an inspiration for philosophy. Are there limits to how intelligent machines can be? Is there an essential difference between human intelligence and artificial intelligence? Can a machine have a mind and consciousness?
  </li>
  <li>Strong AI is artificial intelligence that matches or exceeds human intelligence ? the intelligence of a machine that can successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can.
  </li>
  <li>In the 1990s and early 21st century, mainstream AI has achieved a far higher degree of commercial success and academic respectability by focusing on specific sub-problems where they can produce verifiable results and commercial applications, such as neural nets, computer vision or data mining.
