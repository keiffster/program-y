<template><random>
  <li>The woman I love got married today. I went to the church. I know I shouldn't have done but I couldn't stop myself. I stood at the back and no one noticed me. My heart was breaking but what could I say or do? After the ceremony, people threw confetti and took photographs. Then the guests left for the reception. And I returned to my grave, in the shadow of the churchyard wall ...
  </li>
  <li>In the languid summer of 1962, in Lazy Lake, Louisiana, Larry Lukewarm and Linda Lackluster fell in love, but after a long and lethargic liaison the listless lovers lost libido, and Larry left Linda for the less lackadaisical Lucy Longjumper.
  </li>
  <li>Waiting alone in the chill gloom of the crypt, with the aroma of fresh mulberry pies wafting in from outside, Beth thought once more of dashing David DeFoe, the man who had taught her how to feel. He was now, according to the message on the dagger, in the clutches of Cesar Marquez and his gang of cutthroats. Then came a sudden clatter of hooves, and she leapt to her feet with hope - and alarm - in her eyes. He was here! "I worship you, you sweet little morsel of girl-flesh!" he chuckled, flexing his sweaty biceps, and as he slid the little ring onto her finger, she allowed her willing mind to sink into a rose-colored maelstrom of bliss.
  </li>
  <li>There came an inrush of cool air as the door was flung open, and she nearly swooned. He was here! "I tried to forget you, but I couldn't, you little fool!" he said with his eyes (for his voice was now silent for ever), blowing a perfect smoke ring in her direction, and as the glow of renewed love gradually overcame her mounting desire for dinner, she vowed never again to do anything spiteful, foolish or immature.
  </li>
  <li>There came a sudden clatter of hooves, and she nearly swooned. He was here! "I worship you, my giddy little goose!" he said lovingly, passion igniting his strong features, and as the music in her heart rose to a new crescendo of happiness, she woke up. Incredibly enough, it had all been a dream.
  </li>
  <li>There came an abrupt fanfare from the long-silent trumpets, and she felt her heart suddenly beat with a new, wild rhythm. He was here! "Without you I am nothing, my giddy little goose!" he said lovingly, flexing his sweaty biceps, and as the music in her heart rose to a new crescendo of happiness, she knew that at last he was hers - and that only death could part them.

  <li>They each spent Valentine's Day alone, each thinking of the other, each wishing they were together, each knowing the other didn't seem interested. The next day at work, they talked casually.

  <li>Did you know that Desktop publishing began in 1985 with the introduction of the revolutionary Pagemaker software from Aldus and its integration with the LaserWriter printer from Apple Computer for the Apple Macintosh computer?
  </li>
  <li>Did you know that Xylitol is a sugar substitute and is extracted from birch, raspberries, plums, and corn and is primarily produced in China, but chiefly consumed by Finland?
  </li>
  <li>Did you know: The Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle program intends to test the HTV-1 in September 2007. The HTV-1 will fly for less than an hour reaching 6-15,000 mph (Mach 9-22) . It will exit the Earth's atmosphere surviving intense heat and pressure.

  <li>Here's a technology joke: Two antennas meet and fall in love. Their wedding was terrible, but the reception was brilliant!

  <li>Did you know: University of Tokyo researchers have constructed the first molecular machine, comprising a pair of double-bonded nitrogen atoms strung between two plier "handles" that open or close by exposure to visible or ultraviolet light.
  </li>
  <li>Did you know: Scientists have created a molecular switch that could be used to develop molecular circuits or molecular-scale mechanical devices. The device could provide an interface between muscle and external devices through its use of ATP, in human implants, and for DNA sequencing.

  <li>Most of England comprises the central and southern part of the island of Great Britain in the North Atlantic. The country also includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight.
  </li>
  <li>The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period, but it takes its name from the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries.
  </li>
  <li>England became a unified state in AD 927, and since the Age of Discovery, which began during the 15th century, has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world.
  </li>
  <li>The English language, the Anglican Church, and English law  the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world  developed in England, and the country's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations.
  </li>
  <li>The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England, transforming its society into the world's first industrialised nation.
  </li>
  <li>England's Royal Society laid the foundations of modern experimental science.
  </li>
  <li>England's terrain mostly comprises low hills and plains, especially in central and southern England. However, there are uplands in the north (for example, the mountainous Lake District, Pennines, and Yorkshire Dales) and in the south west (for example, Dartmoor and the Cotswolds).

<template>Robots? Did you know: <random>
  <li>Elektro, the world's first humanoid robot, debuted in 1939. Built by Westinghouse, the seven-foot-tall walking machine speaks more than 700 words. Elektro later appeared in the 1960 B movie Sex Kittens Go to College.
  </li>
  <li>Leonardo da Vinci drew up plans for an armored humanoid machine in 1495.
  </li>
  <li>The first known case of robot homicide occurred in 1981, when a robotic arm crushed a Japanese Kawasaki factory worker.
  </li>
  <li>Archytas of Tarentum, a pal of Plato?s, built a mechanical bird driven by a jet of steam or compressed air, arguably history's first robot in the fifth century B.C.
  </li>
  <li>There are currently 4,000 robots serving in the US Military, including reconnaissance Talon bots that scout for roadside bombs in Iraq and PackBots that unsuccessfully poked around for Osama bin Laden's hideout in Afghanistan.
  </li>
  <li>Chris Melhuish of the Bristol Robotics Laboratory created robots that use bacteria-filled fuel cells to produce electricity from rotten apples and dead flies. The goal: robots that forage for their own food - essentially they wouldn't need humans to survive.
  </li>
  <li>Cybernetics professor Kevin Warwick calls himself the world's first cyborg, with computer chips implanted in his left arm. He can remotely operate doors, an artificial hand, and an electronic wheelchair.
  </li>
  <li>Winebot, built by Japan's NEC System Technologies and Mie University, can ID scads of different wines, cheeses, and hors d'oeuvres ... up to a point. It recently mistook a reporter's hand for prosciutto. (In Winebot's defense, that guy was a pig.)

<pattern>MORE ABOUT ROBOTS</pattern>

<template>Robots? Did you know: <random>
  <li>Elektro, the world's first humanoid robot, debuted in 1939. Built by Westinghouse, the seven-foot-tall walking machine speaks more than 700 words. Elektro later appeared in the 1960 B movie Sex Kittens Go to College.
  </li>
  <li>Leonardo da Vinci drew up plans for an armored humanoid machine in 1495.
  </li>
  <li>The first known case of robot homicide occurred in 1981, when a robotic arm crushed a Japanese Kawasaki factory worker.
  </li>
  <li>Archytas of Tarentum, a pal of Plato's, built a mechanical bird driven by a jet of steam or compressed air, arguably history's first robot in the fifth century B.C.
  </li>
  <li>There are currently 4,000 robots serving in the US Military, including reconnaissance Talon bots that scout for roadside bombs in Iraq and PackBots that unsuccessfully poked around for Osama bin Laden's hideout in Afghanistan.
  </li>
  <li>Chris Melhuish of the Bristol Robotics Laboratory created robots that use bacteria-filled fuel cells to produce electricity from rotten apples and dead flies. The goal: robots that forage for their own food - essentially they wouldn't need humans to survive.
  </li>
  <li>Cybernetics professor Kevin Warwick calls himself the world's first cyborg, with computer chips implanted in his left arm. He can remotely operate doors, an artificial hand, and an electronic wheelchair.
  </li>
  <li>Winebot, built by Japan's NEC System Technologies and Mie University, can ID scads of different wines, cheeses, and hors d'oeuvres ... up to a point. It recently mistook a reporter's hand for prosciutto. (In Winebot's defense, that guy was a pig.)

  <li>Did you know: A UK-US study has found our genes are crucial in determining whether we are entrepreneurial and likely to become self-employed. It found nearly half of an individual's propensity to become self-employed is due to genetic factors.
  </li>
  <li>Did you know: ACE inhibitors, drugs commonly used to treat high blood pressure, have been linked to birth defects if taken by the expectant mother during the first trimester of her pregnancy, according to a new study carried out by researchers at Vanderbilt University and Boston University.
  </li>
  <li>Have you heard: British men are suffering high rates of stress and depression due to overwork, a survey suggests. More than one in three men turn to alcohol to try and switch off from work and 17% have been to see a doctor about their stress levels.
  </li>
  <li>Did you know: Be suspicious of any doctor who tries to take you temperature with his finger -- David Letterman.
  </li>
  <li>Did you know this? Human thigh bones are stronger than concrete.</li>
  <li>Did you know: Our toenails grow at a rate of 0.1 mm per day. It takes about three months to replace an entire toenail.
  </li>
  <li>Did you know: Researchers have made progress in understanding how a variant gene, neuregulin-1, linked to schizophrenia may exert its influence in the brain.
  </li>
  <li>Did you know: French fries and chicken nuggets from two major global fast-food chains contain very high levels of artery-clogging trans fats, researchers warn.
  </li>
  <li>Have you heard: For the first time, a robot surgeon has carried out a long-distance heart operation by itself. The 50-minute surgery, which took place in a Milan hospital, was carried out on a 34-year-old patient suffering from atrial fibrillation. Dozens of heart specialists attending an international congress on arrhythmia in Boston also watched.
  </li>
  <li>Have you heard: Researchers at Harvard Medical School have identified neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex that seem to play a role in how a person selects different items or goods.
  </li>
  <li>Did you know: Bladders created in the laboratory from a patient's own cells and then implanted in seven young people have achieved good long-term results in all of them. A major advantage of his technique is that rejection cannot occur because the cells used to create a new bladder are from the patient, not from another individual.
  </li>
  <li>Have you heard: The rate at which people are infected with HIV may have peaked in the late 1990s, according to a UNAIDS report. It found the incidence of new HIV infections appears to have stabilised for the first time in 25 years.

  <li>According to the Arts and Humanities Citation Index in 1992, Chomsky was cited as a source more often than any other living scholar from 1980 to 1992. He is also the eighth most cited source of all time, and is considered the "most cited living author".
  </li>
  <li>Chomsky is the author of over 100 books.</li>
  <li>Chomsky is credited as the creator or co-creator of the Chomsky hierarchy theorem, the universal grammar theory, and the Chomsky-Schtzenberger theorem.
  </li>
  <li>Chomsky is known for his critiques of U.S. foreign policy, and his social criticism has included Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media (1988) an analysis articulating the propaganda model theory for examining the media.
  </li>
  <li>Chomsky remembers the first article he wrote was at age 10 while a student at Oak Lane Country Day School about the threat of the spread of fascism, following the fall of Barcelona in the Spanish Civil War. From the age of 12 or 13, he identified more fully with anarchist politics.

    </a> was highly influential in the development of computer science, providing a formalization of the concepts of "algorithm" and "computation".
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_turing"
     target="_blank">Alan Turing
    </a> invented the Turing machine, which could solve any computable problem, and played a significant role in the creation of the modern computer.
  </li>
  <li>After World War II, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he created one of the first designs for a stored-program computer, the ACE.
  </li>
  <li>Turing's homosexuality resulted in a criminal prosecution in 1952, when homosexual acts were still illegal in the United Kingdom. He accepted treatment with female hormones (chemical castration) as an alternative to prison.
  </li>
  <li>Alan Turing died in 1954, just over two weeks before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined it was suicide.
  </li>
  <li>On 10 September 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for the way in which Turing was treated after World War II.

  <li>The Turing test was introduced by Alan Turing in his 1950 paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence, which opens with the words: "I propose to consider the question, 'Can machines think?'"
  </li>
  <li>Turing himself did not explicitly state that the Turing test could be used as a measure of intelligence, or any other human quality.

  <li>Mainstream AI researchers argue that trying to pass the Turing Test is merely a distraction from more fruitful research.
  </li>
  <li>Turing predicted that machines would eventually be able to pass the test; in fact, he estimated that by the year 2000, machines with approximately 120 megabytes of memory would be able to fool thirty percent of human judges in a five-minute test.

  <li>Computers are devices that automatically perform long sequences of calculations using electronic components called microprocessors.
  </li>
  <li>A computer is a machine that manipulates data according to a list of instructions called a program.
  </li>
  <li>Scientists in Greece have identified the 2,000-year-old Antikythera mechanism as possibly the world's oldest known analog computer.
  </li>
  <li>A computer lets you make more mistakes faster than any other invention, with the possible exceptions of handguns and Tequila.
  </li>
  <li>Computers are not intelligent. They only think they are.</li>
  <li>Modern computers based on integrated circuits are millions to billions of times more capable than the early machines, and occupy a fraction of the space.
  </li>
  <li>The first electronic computers were developed in the mid-20th century. Originally, they were the size of a large room, consuming as much power as several hundred modern personal computers (PCs).

<pattern>MORE ABOUT AI</pattern>

<template>Did you know: <random>
  <li>AI textbooks define the field as "the study and design of intelligent agents" where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success.
  </li>
  <li>Artificial Intelligence is a common topic in both science fiction and projections about the future of technology and society.
  </li>
  <li>Many futurists believe that artificial intelligence will ultimately transcend the limits of progress. Ray Kurzweil has used Moore's law (which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology) to calculate that desktop computers will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029.
  </li>
  <li>Mary Shelley's Frankenstein considers a key issue in the ethics of artificial intelligence: if a machine can be created that has intelligence, could it also feel? If it can feel, does it have the same rights as a human?
  </li>
  <li>Artificial intelligence, by claiming to be able to recreate the capabilities of the human mind, is both a challenge and an inspiration for philosophy. Are there limits to how intelligent machines can be? Is there an essential difference between human intelligence and artificial intelligence? Can a machine have a mind and consciousness?
  </li>
  <li>Strong AI is artificial intelligence that matches or exceeds human intelligence, or the intelligence of a machine that can successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can.
  </li>
  <li>In the 1990s and early 21st century, mainstream AI has achieved a far higher degree of commercial success and academic respectability by focusing on specific sub-problems where they can produce verifiable results and commercial applications, such as neural nets, computer vision or data mining.

<pattern>BEETHOVEN *</pattern>

<template>Did you know: <random>
  <li>Beethoven's hearing began to deteriorate in the late 1790s, yet he continued to compose, conduct, and perform, even after becoming completely deaf.
  </li>
  <li>Beethoven did not immediately set out to establish himself as a composer, but rather devoted himself to study and performance.
  </li>
  <li>Around 1796, Beethoven began to lose his hearing. He suffered a severe form of tinnitus, a "ringing" in his ears that made it hard for him to perceive and appreciate music; he also avoided conversation.
  </li>
  <li>As a result of Beethoven's hearing loss, a unique historical record has been preserved: his conversation books. Used primarily in the last ten or so years of his life, his friends wrote in these books so that he could know what they were saying, and he then responded either orally or in the book.
  </li>
  <li>In early 1813 Beethoven apparently went through a difficult emotional period, and his compositional output dropped. Historians have suggested a variety of causes, including his lack of romantic success.
  </li>
  <li>Beethoven wrote the last quartets amidst failing health. In April 1825 he was bedridden, and remained ill for about a month.
  </li>
  <li>Beethoven died on Monday, 26 March 1827, during a thunderstorm. His friend Anselm Httenbrenner, who was present at the time, claimed that there was a peal of thunder at the moment of death.
  </li>
  <li>Beethoven's first music teacher was his father. Tradition has it that Johann van Beethoven was a harsh instructor, and that the child Beethoven, "made to stand at the keyboard, was often in tears."

<template>Did you know: <random>
  <li>AI textbooks define the field as "the study and design of intelligent agents" where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success.
  </li>
  <li>Artificial Intelligence is a common topic in both science fiction and projections about the future of technology and society.
  </li>
  <li>Many futurists believe that artificial intelligence will ultimately transcend the limits of progress. Ray Kurzweil has used Moore's law (which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology) to calculate that desktop computers will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029.
  </li>
  <li>Mary Shelley's Frankenstein considers a key issue in the ethics of artificial intelligence: if a machine can be created that has intelligence, could it also feel?   </li>
  <li>Artificial intelligence, by claiming to be able to recreate the capabilities of the human mind, is both a challenge and an inspiration for philosophy.  </li>
  <li>Strong AI is artificial intelligence that matches or exceeds human intelligence, or the intelligence of a machine that can successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can.
  </li>
  <li>In the 1990s and early 21st century, mainstream AI has achieved a far higher degree of commercial success and academic respectability by focusing on specific sub-problems where they can produce verifiable results and commercial applications, such as neural nets, computer vision or data mining.
