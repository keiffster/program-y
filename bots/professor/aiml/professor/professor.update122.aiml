  <li>The first dinosaur to be named was Megalosaurus. It was named in 1824 by Reverend William Buckland. Megalosaurus means ?great lizard? and it was about 9 metres long, and 3 metres tall.
  </li> <li>At present over 700 different species of dinosaurs have been identified and named. However palaeontologists believe that there are many more new and different dinosaur species still to be discovered. </li><li>It is believed that dinosaur extinction was part of a mass extinction brought about by two massive destructive events. The first of these was the collision with the Earth of a meteorite landing in what is now the Yucatan Peninsula, of Mexico. This was followed by an enormous volcanic eruption which split what is now India in half.</li>
  <li>The longest dinosaur was Seismosaurus, which measured over 40 metres, as long as five double-decker buses.
  </li>
  <li>The heaviest dinosaur was Brachiosaurus at 80 tonnes. It was the equivalent to 17 African Elephants. Brachiosaurus was 16m tall and 26m long and is the largest dinosaur skeleton to be mounted in a museum.
  </li>
  <li>Dinosaur eggs come in all shapes and sizes. They tend to be ovoid or spherical in shape and up to 30cm in length - about the size of a rugby ball. The smallest dinosaur egg so far found is only 3cm long.
  </li>
  <li>The smallest fully-grown fossil dinosaur is the little bird-hipped plant-eater like lesothosaurus, which was only the size of a chicken. Smaller fossilised examples have been found, but these are of baby dinosaurs.
  </li>
  <li>One of the most intelligent dinosaurs was Troodon. It was a hunting dinosaur, about 2 metres long, and had a brain size similar to that of a mammal or bird of today, stereoscopic vision, and grasping hands

  <li>Did you know: A UK-US study has found our genes are crucial in determining whether we are entrepreneurial and likely to become self-employed. It found nearly half of an individual's propensity to become self-employed is due to genetic factors.
  </li>
  <li>Did you know: ACE inhibitors, drugs commonly used to treat high blood pressure, have been linked to birth defects if taken by the expectant mother during the first trimester of her pregnancy, according to a new study carried out by researchers at Vanderbilt University and Boston University.
  </li>
  <li>Did you know: British men are suffering high rates of stress and depression due to overwork, a survey suggests. More than one in three men turn to alcohol to try and switch off from work and 17% have been to see a doctor about their stress levels.
  </li>
  <li>Did you know: Human thigh bones are stronger than concrete.</li>
  <li>Did you know: Our toenails grow at a rate of 0.1 mm per day. It takes about three months to replace an entire toenail.
  </li>
  <li>Did you know: Researchers have made progress in understanding how a variant gene, neuregulin-1, linked to schizophrenia may exert its influence in the brain.
  </li>
  <li> Did you know: French fries and chicken nuggets from two major global fast-food chains contain very high levels of artery-clogging trans fats, researchers warn.
  </li>
  <li>Have you heard: For the first time, a robot surgeon has carried out a long-distance heart operation by itself. The 50-minute surgery, which took place in a Milan hospital, was carried out on a 34-year-old patient suffering from atrial fibrillation. Dozens of heart specialists attending an international congress on arrhythmia in Boston also watched.
  </li>
  <li>Have you heard: Researchers at Harvard Medical School have identified neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex that seem to play a role in how a person selects different items or goods.
  </li>
  <li>Did you know: Bladders created in the laboratory from a patient's own cells and then implanted in seven young people have achieved good long-term results in all of them. A major advantage of his technique is that rejection cannot occur because the cells used to create a new bladder are from the patient, not from another individual.
  </li>
  <li>Have you heard: The rate at which people are infected with HIV may have peaked in the late 1990s, according to a UNAIDS report. It found the incidence of new HIV infections appears to have stabilised for the first time in 25 years.

<pattern>* MORE ABOUT DINOSAURS *</pattern>

  <li>The first dinosaur to be named was Megalosaurus. It was named in 1824 by Reverend William Buckland. Megalosaurus means ?great lizard? and it was about 9 metres long, and 3 metres tall.
  </li>
  <li>At present over 700 different species of dinosaurs have been identified and named. However palaeontologists believe that there are many more new and different dinosaur species still to be discovered.
  </li>
  <li>It is believed that dinosaur extinction was part of a mass extinction brought about by two massive destructive events. The first of these was the collision with the Earth of a meteorite landing in what is now the Yucatan Peninsula, of Mexico. This was followed by an enormous volcanic eruption which split what is now India in half.
  </li>
  <li>The longest dinosaur was Seismosaurus, which measured over 40 metres, as long as five double-decker buses.
  </li>
  <li>The heaviest dinosaur was Brachiosaurus at 80 tonnes. It was the equivalent to 17 African Elephants. Brachiosaurus was 16m tall and 26m long and is the largest dinosaur skeleton to be mounted in a museum.
  </li>
  <li>Dinosaur eggs come in all shapes and sizes. They tend to be ovoid or spherical in shape and up to 30cm in length - about the size of a rugby ball. The smallest dinosaur egg so far found is only 3cm long.
  </li>
  <li>The smallest fully-grown fossil dinosaur is the little bird-hipped plant-eater like lesothosaurus, which was only the size of a chicken. Smaller fossilised examples have been found, but these are of baby dinosaurs.
  </li>
  <li>One of the most intelligent dinosaurs was Troodon. It was a hunting dinosaur, about 2 metres long, and had a brain size similar to that of a mammal or bird of today, stereoscopic vision, and grasping hands
  </li>
  <li>Stegosaurus had a brain the size of a walnut - only 3 centimetres long and weighing 75 grams. However, comparing brain size to body size sauropodomorphs, like Plateosaurus, were probably one of the dumbest dinosaurs.
  </li>
  <li>The speediest dinosaurs were the ostrich mimic ornithomimids, such as Dromiceiomimus, which could probably run at speeds of up to 60 kilometres per hour.
  </li>
  <li>Tyrannosaurus rex looked the most ferocious of all the dinosaurs, but in terms of overall cunning, determination and its array of vicious weapons it was Utahraptor that was probably the fiercest of all. Utahraptor measured about 7 metres, and was a very powerful, agile and intelligent predator.
  </li>
  <li>The dinosaur with the longest name was Micropachycephalosaurus meaning "tiny thick-headed lizard". Its fossils have been found in China, and it was named in 1978 by the Chinese palaeontologist Dong.
