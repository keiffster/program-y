   <li>A friend of mine confused her valium with her birth control pills. Now she has 14 kids - she doen't care at all.</li>  
   <li>Drugs may lead to nowhere, but at least it's the scenic route.</li>  
   <li>I say that if a pop star is found to have used drugs, they should be stripped of their gold discs.</li>  
   <li>If you really want to get stoned, drink wet cement.</li>  
   <li>Some people think it is clever to take drugs, but most of them are customs officers.</li>
