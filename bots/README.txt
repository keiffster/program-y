This folder contains a number of specific bots

Alice2 - Is the bot that was created to support AIML 2, and is an updated version of Alicebot which was the original
bot created for AIML 1. It has a comprehensive set of grammars but is very America in some of its responses. Also I
some of the more complex grammars either rely on none AIML 2.0 which are only implemented in the Pandora Bots. Still its
a good start for mosts people

Rosie - A second bot created by the creators of AIML. Rosie has less grammars but is designed and documented to be
the foundation for AIML 2.0 bot development. Easier to work with than Alice2, but still has one or 2 tags which are not
AIML 2 compliant and only work with Pandora bots

Roise_fixed - My attempt to provide a full AIML 2.0 compliant version of Rosie which only uses AIML 2.0 tags. A work in
progress

Y-Bot - This is my bot, being developed slowly with a complete set of grammar tests. Y-Bot is designed to both have a
good core knowledge for general discussions, a personality and also support a set of industry extensions such for use
iin Energy, Banking, and Telecoms
